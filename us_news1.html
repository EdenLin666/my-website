      <h1>Tensions Rise in South China Sea as Naval Drills Expand</h1>
      <div class="date">Published：2025/05/01</div>
      <p>
        Recent joint military exercises by the US, Japan, and the Philippines in the South China Sea have provoked strong reactions from China. Experts warn that the region is becoming increasingly militarized and may evolve into a flashpoint of great power competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The South China Sea has long been a hotspot for territorial disputes. China claims historical rights within its self-declared "nine-dash line," a claim not recognized by international law. The US and its allies maintain freedom of navigation in these waters and frequently conduct naval patrols.
      </p>
      <p>
        In late April, the US, Japan, and the Philippines launched “Operation Sea Hawk,” involving amphibious landings, anti-submarine warfare, and island defense drills off the Philippine coast. China condemned the drills as “provocative” and deployed its own fleet for “routine patrols.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The US Department of Defense stated the exercises were “essential for regional stability.” China’s Foreign Ministry condemned them as escalatory and warned of “necessary countermeasures.” ASEAN countries largely remained silent, with Indonesia calling for restraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Geopolitical analysts see the drills as a clear extension of the US Indo-Pacific strategy and a sign that the Philippines is aligning more closely with Washington. The South China Sea is now a key theater in broader strategic realignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        More military activities are expected in the coming months. Without effective crisis management mechanisms, the risk of accidental conflict could rise. Regional cooperation platforms and multilateral dialogue will be essential to prevent escalation.
